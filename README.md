"This repository contains the code for Gibbs Energy Minimisation.
Currently it is designed for reforming/decomposition of hydrocarbons and 
alcohols in the vapor phase. The code accounts for solid carbon deposition, 
which is of key interest when designing a reactor to minimise coking of 
catalysts."
